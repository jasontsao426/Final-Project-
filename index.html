              <h1>About Us </h1>
              <p> We are an online advirtising platform who brings together divers, who are looking for some extra incomes, and advertisers, who are looking for publicity for their products. Ad&ride is founded based on the idea of shared/gig-economy, where the resources in the society can be utilized and create value for those who are a part of it. We are excited to see more of these collaborations among individuals and corporations in the future. --- Jason Tsao, Founder  </p>
